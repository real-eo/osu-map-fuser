Todo:
+ Implement audio playback
- Implement hitobject rendering
- Implement object selection
- Implement object manipulation (move, resize, etc.)
- Implement spliced map exporting
+ Implement skin for rendering
+ Restructure legacy skin externs
+ Extern legacy skin sprites
- Use preprocessors to always export highest available definition of sprites (HD > SD)
+ Implement externs for animated sprites as a byte matrix (byte array of byte arrays)
- Implement skin functionaliry (hit sounds, etc.)
- Implement audio settings (master vol, music vol, sfx vol)
- Implement scrollable timeline like in osu!editor
+ Store a "name" property for SkinElements to identify them - eg. for sfx playback. This should be done in SkinElement, but resource can also work.
- Implement lookahead for hitobjects based on a map's approach rate (AR)
- Implement sfx playback for hitobjects, only play sfx from the active beatmap
- Implement beatmap class to manage a single beatmap's data
- Implement registry within BeatmapManager to track loaded beatmaps
- Implement beatmap skin loading

Bugs:
- Fix "stoi" exceptions when loading certain beatmaps
+ Fix GCC 15.2.0 build errors
